## What's included:

* [bpptf.py](https://github.com/aschein/bptf/blob/master/code/bptf.py): The main code file.  Implements batch variational inference for BPTF.
* [utils.py](https://github.com/aschein/bptf/blob/master/code/utils.py): Utility functions.  Includes some important multilinear algebra functions (e.g., PARAFAC, Khatri-Rao product), preprocessing functions, privacy noise functions, and serialization functions.

## Dependencies:

* argparse
* numpy
* path
* pickle
* scikit-learn
* scikit-tensor

## How to run the code:

BPTF can be run from the command line as follows:
```
python bptf.py -d=$DATA_DIR/data.dat -o=$OUT_DIR -k=25
```
#### Required arguments:
* `-d` : Path to the pickled data tensor (see below for details on data format)
* `-o` : Directory to dump results
* `-k` : Number of latent components

#### Optional arguments:
* `-m` : Path to a binary mask (e.g., for prediction experiments), default is None
* `-n` : Maximum number of iterations to run inference, default is 200
* `-t` : Tolerance level (inference stops after percent change in the bound is less than this), default is 1e-4
* `-s` : How the smooth random initialization of variational parameters is, default is 100
* `-a` : Alpha, the prior shape parameter for Gamma-distributed latent factors, default is 0.1 (sparsity-inducing)
* `-v` : Verbose (if toggled, inference will printout information every iteration).

### Data format
Input data tensor must be stored as a `numpy.ndarray` or `sktensor.dtensor` (for dense tensors) or a `sktensor.sptensor` (for sparse tensors).  The object can either be pickled with `pickle.dump` into a file with any extension (e.g., `.dat`) or can be put inside a `.npz` file ([Numpy's compressed file format](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.io.html)) along with another other associated arrays (e.g., metadata).  If using a `.npz` file, the data tensor's key must be either be `data` or `Y`.  A few examples are given below:

#### Using `numpy.ndarray` or `sktensor.dtensor` and `pickle`
```
import pickle
import numpy as np
import sktensor as skt

data = np.ones((10, 8, 3), dtype=int)  # 3-mode count tensor of size 10 x 8 x 3
# data = skt.dtensor(data)             # Optional: cast numpy.ndarray as sktensor.dtensor

with open('data.dat', 'w+') as f:      # can be stored as a .dat using pickle
  pickle.dump(data, f)

with open('data.dat', 'r') as f:       # can be loaded back in using pickle.load
  tmp = pickle.load(f)
  assert np.allclose(tmp, data)
```
#### Using `sktensor.sptensor` and `pickle`
```
import numpy.random as rn

data = rn.poisson(0.2, size=(10, 8, 3))  # 3-mode SPARSE count tensor of size 10 x 8 x 3

subs = data.nonzero()                    # subscripts where the ndarray has non-zero entries   
vals = data[data.nonzero()]              # corresponding values of non-zero entries
sp_data = skt.sptensor(subs,             # create an sktensor.sptensor 
                       vals,
                       shape=data.shape,
                       dtype=data.dtype)

with open('data.dat', 'w+') as f:            # can be stored as a .dat using pickle
  pickle.dump(data, f)

with open('data.dat', 'r') as f:             # can be loaded back in using pickle.load
  tmp = pickle.load(f)
  assert np.allclose(tmp.vals, sp_data.vals)
```
#### Using `numpy.ndarray` and `numpy.savez` for `.npz` files
```
data = np.ones((10, 8, 3), dtype=int)   # 3-mode count tensor of size 10 x 8 x 3
labels = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']          # list of index labels for the last mode

with open('data.npz', 'w+') as f:       # both arrays can be stored in a Numpy pickle dictionary
  np.savez(f, data=data, labels=labels) # also see numpy.savez_compressed

data_dict = np.load('data.npz')         # can be loaded back in with numpy.load
tmp_data = data_dict['data']
tmp_labels = data_dict['labels']
assert np.allclose(tmp_data, data)
assert np.allclose(tmp_labels, labels) 
```
# Output:
Results will be serialized in a `.npz` file in the given output directory.  By default, if no results files exist in the provided directory, the results file will be called `1_trained_model.npz`.  If results files are already present, the results file will be named by incrementing the latest (e.g., `6_trained_model.npz` if 5 already exist).  In addition, a file containing the dictionary of initial parameters (e.g., `n_components`, `alpha`) is pickled as `1_trained_model.dat`.  The `.npz` file contains the inferred variational parameters, expectations of the latent factors (computed from the variational parameters), and inferred rate parameters.
```
import numpy as np

results = np.load('1_trained_model.npz')

# Variational parameters
gamma_DK_M = results['gamma_DK_M'] # shape variational parameters
delta_DK_M = results['delta_DK_M'] # rate variational parameters

# Expectations of factors
E_DK_M = results['E_DK_M']  # arithmetic expectation
G_DK_M = results['G_DK_M']  # geometric expectation

# Inferred rate parameters
beta_M = results['beta_M']
```
The naming convention `_DK_M` tells you the size/shape of the object.  A variable with one underscore---e.g., `E_DK`---is a `numpy.ndarray` that has shape (D, K).  A variable with two underscores---e.g., `E_DK_M`---is a Python `list` of M `numpy.ndarray` objects each with shape (Dm, K), where the first dimension (Dm) may be different across the M arrays but the second dimension K (number of components) is shared.

Either of the two lists `E_DK_M` and `G_DK_M` correspond to the usual list of factor matrices returned by any tensor factorization (CP-decomposition/PARAFAC) model.  They are two different point-estimates (i.e., expectations) of the factor matrices under the variational distribution.  For more information on the two expectations, see Section 7 of the paper.
